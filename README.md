# FMNIST_Dataset_Classification
In this project the Images belong to 10 classes are classified by using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in colab.

1-The datasets that we are going to use is what we call the fashion MNIST dataset.So it's kind of a grayscale images Of different categories including for example dresses coats sneakers bags and so on.

2-Our objective is to build the classifiers which is kind of a deep learning network that can look at these images and can tell us this image basically belongs to one of these target classes.

3-The dataset contains 70000 images each 28 by 28 pixels.They are divided into 60000 training datasets and 10000 testing datasets.

4-Before runing colab file you have to download data from kaggle. It has two csv files named as fashion-mnist_test and fashion-mnist_train.

5-Put the above files in folder named as fmnistData.And this folder should be in FashionMNIST(where FashionClassification.ipynb is present).

6-Now you are all ready to run this file on colab:)
